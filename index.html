<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-PlayStation-Hits-Standard-4/dp/B01GKHJP98?th=1"> Persona 5</a>  was released in April 4, 2017 and it was one of the best procliamed games of the year. It may have lost the Game Of The Year award but it stoled the hearts of new fans. Persona 5 is a one of the memerable games of the decade, and it has the right to be so. From Persona 5's magestic UI, addicting combat, killer sound track, relatable characters, over the top plot. </p>

<h1>Over the Top Plot</h1>

<p>When I said that the plot is plot is over the top it is <b>over the top</b>. To boil down the plot of Persona 5 it is some akward teens fighting against the will of the fake <b>god</b> <em><b>Yaldabaoth</b></em>.</p>

<h1>The Killer Sound Track</h1>

<p>Persona's sound tract is iconic. Persona 5's sountract has many songs thast are able to stay in your brain such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rivers In A Desert</li>
    <li>Life Will Change </li>
    <li>Last Surprise</li>
    <li>Wake Up Get Out There</li>
    <li>Beneath The Mask</li>
</ul>


<p>As Nathan Rodrigues says</p>

<q>"The vocals on point, most Persona 5 songs slap"</q>

<p>In my opinion I would rank the soundtracts as:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Persona 5</li>
    <li>Persona 3</li>
    <li>Persona 4</li>
    <li>Persona 2</li>
    <li>Persona 1</li>
</ol>

<h1>Game PLay</h1>

<p>Persona has always been a turn-based game. After all this years Atlus has almost perfected the combat. With baton passes which let your ally hit an enemy after a down or critical, they also have an all-out attack which is activated after all the enemies are downed. Persona also had a deep system where you are able to create Persona's to your own liking. Each persona is able to take on every persona if leveled up correctly. </p>

<h1>Final Score</h1>

<p><b>The Final Score for Persona 5 is 9/10</b></p>

<p>A perfect game does not excist but Persona 5 comes close to being that game as the people who play it, will forever remember it. It truly stole our hearts.</p>
